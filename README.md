# DRSS sensor array calibration
## Observability Analysis
Run the *OA_main.m* file in the *Observability_analysis* folder.
    For each scenario inside, uncomment the code and run to examine the results separately.
## Calibration Algorithm
Run the *CA_main.m* file in the *Calibration_algorithms* folder.
    If the process continues more than a minute without stopping, it indicates that the initial values are not good enough. After forcibly stopping, re-run the process.
